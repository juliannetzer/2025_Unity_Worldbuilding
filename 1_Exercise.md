# Exercises for Session 1: Create a Small Diorama

Goal: Combine everything you've learned to create a cohesive mini-scene.

- Use basic 3D objects and imported models to create a small environment (e.g., a park, room, or simple outdoor space).
- Apply materials and textures to make it visually interesting.
- Adjust the scale, position, and rotation of objects to create a natural composition.
- Organize your Hierarchy by grouping related objects into Empty GameObjects.
- Save the scene as "DioramaScene.unity".
