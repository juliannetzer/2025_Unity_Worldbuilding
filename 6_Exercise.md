# Final Exercise: Add a Custom Interactive Element to Your Diorama Using Code

Finalize your scene using basic scripting and/or an AI assistant to add a small interactive feature to your Unity scene.

- Open your existing diorama scene from a previous session (e.g., "DioramaSession5.unity").
- Choose one interaction to implement using either your own code or with the help of ChatGPT or Claude:
    - Trigger a light to turn on when the player approaches.
    - Play a sound only when the player enters a specific area.
    - Change the color, size, or position of an object on proximity.
    - Spawn a clone of an object when interacted with.
    - Animate an object or switch between multiple animations.
- Write or generate the script:
    - Create a new C# script in Unity (Assets → Create → C# Script).
    - Ask your LLM (e.g. ChatGPT or Claude) for help using a prompt.
    - Paste the script into your new file and attach it to a suitable GameObject.
- Test the interaction:
    - Ensure your GameObject has the required components (e.g., Collider, AudioSource, Light).
    - Press Play and confirm that your feature works.
    - Ask your LLM for help if something is not working

- Document your prompt (optional):
    - Save or screenshot the prompt you used and note what changes you made to the code (if any).
