# Session 2: Expand Your Diorama with a Custom 3D Object

Goal: Apply what you’ve learned to enrich your diorama with a 3D object created using one of the explored methods.
Instructions:

- Open the scene you created in Session 1 (your Diorama or basic composition).
- Choose one method for creating a 3D object:
    - Use the Terrain Tool to expand the environment (e.g., add hills, paths, or landscape variations).
    - Create a model in an online sculpting tool like SculptGL or MonsterMash.
    - Generate a model using an AI tool like Lumalabs Genie or Hyper3D.
    - Capture a real object with a 3D scanning app like Polycam or Luma AI.
- Import the object into Unity and place it meaningfully within your scene.
- Apply at least one material or texture to the new object.
- Use an Empty GameObject to organize the new element under a group (e.g., “ImportedObjects”).
- Save the updated scene as "DioramaSession2.unity".
