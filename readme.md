# Introduction to Worldbuilding in Unity3D 

This course is designed for artists and designers interested in building virtual world in the GameEngine Unity3D. Over three sessions, we will explore the fundamentals of Unity, from working with 3D objects and textures to creating interactive elements through coding.

This course is structured as a hands-on introduction to worldbuilding in Unity, guiding you through essential topics such as terrain creation, animation, and visual effects. We will also dive into scripting, collaboration tools, and methods for integrating assets from various sources.

By the end of this course, you will have developed a foundational understanding of Unity as a creative tool, enabling you to build your own interactive worlds.
